In this i created a basic keylogger program form pre-build libraries that records and logs keystrokes.
Keyloggers, which record keystrokes, have serious ethical and legal implications. It is essential to only use such software in authorized environments, where users are fully aware of its presence (e.g., for personal development and research on your own systems, or when you have explicit permission to monitor activities on a device).

How It Works:
The program will log every keystroke made by the user.
The logged data will be stored in a file.
We'll use the pynput library to capture keystrokes.

To run the keylogger, you need to install the pynput library, which allows you to monitor input devices like the keyboard.

Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to install pynput
Here is how to install pynput in cmd: pip install pynput 
Run the script and save the scipt with extension .py
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the script is saved.
Run the keylogger using python filename.py
After running the program, you can open the key_log.txt file to see the recorded keystrokes.

Note :- This code is provided strictly for educational purposes. Misuse of keyloggers is illegal and can violate privacy laws. Always ensure that you have explicit permission before using a keylogger on any device.
